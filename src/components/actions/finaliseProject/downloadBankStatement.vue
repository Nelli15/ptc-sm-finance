    Download the bank statement for the cash card used on Project. If you cannot
    download the statement within one week of your project finishing, take
    screenshots which include every transaction made on the cash card.<br /><br />
    The first transaction in the statement should be the money deposited onto
    the cash card by National Summer Projects and include the entirety of your
    Projectâ€™s transactions. Wait for all the transactions to be fully processed
    before downloading the Bank Statement.
